# Tattoo App Frontend

## Project Pitch
For our final project as part of the Java development bootcamp at Northcoders. A way we find out a lot of information
about tattoo artist is them posting their work on various social media sites. However, if you are someone who wants to
find a tattoo artist or wants to find a tattoo design you might like this might mean traversing multiple sites which
are not set up for this particular problem. So we have made an app which can streamline a process for looking for a
tattoo which can show you where various artist are based.
